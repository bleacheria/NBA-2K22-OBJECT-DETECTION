# NBA 2K22 OBJECT DETECTION

##### This script was made with the of the following technologies and libraries:
-	*Python*
-	*GPC (a language with a C-like syntax that is used for scripting through Titan / Cronus devices)*
-	*Yolo-v4-Tiny*

It uses Object Detection with Yolo to detect the shot meter in NBA 2K 2K22 – it automates the speed of which the user takes the shot so that it will be the perfect timing most times. This way the shot will almost always go in. This is aimed towards those who are at a disadvantage when it comes to playing video games; it allows them to find joy in games that conditions would normally make hard for them to play.
